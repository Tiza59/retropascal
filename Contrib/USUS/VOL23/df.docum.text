                DF   Directory-File utility

          The Directory-File utility displays a volume
directory on a crt screen.  The operator can select a file
with the cursor and perform functions from a menu with the
selected file name.  Menu selected options include
modification or removal of a file name, moving a file to
another volume, entering the SYSTEM.EDITOR, and execution
of a code file or initiation of a script file. 

Operation of the Directory-File utility

          DF is called into operation by executing the file /DF. 
The utility will clear the screen and request
identification of the volume whose directory is to be
displayed.

Example:
          
   Enter volume id of disk(<ESC>,<RETURN> to end) [prefix]=>

Possible entries in responce to this prompt are:

1)        Press the keys labeled <ESC> and <RETURN>.  The utility
          will relenquish control to the operating system.
          
2)        Press the key labeled <RETURN>.  The utility will use
          the volume identification displayed inside the square
          brackets.
          
3)        Input a number followed by the <RETURN> key.  The number
          must identify a device which contains a blocked volume.  
          (note: this volume identification will become the default
          volume in square brackets.)
          
4)        Input a volume identification as defined by the PASCAL
          operating system.  The volume identification may be a
          volume name, a device name or a device number (prefixed
          with a # character).  (note: this volume identification
          will become the default volume in square brackets.)
          
With the entry of a volume identification, the utility will
display the file names from the directory in order of
occurrence.  The screen will contain a menu line, the
volume name, up to twenty rows in four columns of file
names, the number of files defined, and the number of
blocks available in the largest contiguous area.  Sharing
the line with the volume name is the extended directory
information for the file pointed to by the cursor.  This
includes the file name, block length, last modification
date, starting block address, number of bytes in the last
block of the file, and the file type.

          The first line of the screen display is a menu list of
the functions available.  Additional functions are
displayed on entry of a ?.  The cursor will be on the
first character of the first file.  Selection of the file
to be affected by a function is made with the cursor.




          Every option is selectable by entering the first
character of the option name or the special key indicated
in angular brackets. ( i.e. <ENTER> means the key with
the word ENTER engraved on it.)

1 <arrows>

          The arrow keys move the cursor one file name in the
          direction indicated by the arrow on the key pressed.  The
          cursor will be positioned on the first character of the
          file name except when a Change operation is in progress.
          
          The left arrow key will move the cursor one column of
          file names to the left. When in the leftmost column, the
          cursor will be moved to the rightmost column.
          
          The right arrow key or the tab key will move the cursor
          one column of file names to the right.  When in the
          rightmost column, the cursor will be moved to the leftmost
          column.
          
          The up arrow key will move the cursor up one row in the
          same column.  When on the top row, the cursor will be moved
          to the bottom row in the same column.
          
          The down arrow key will move the cursor down one row in
          the same column.  When on the bottom row, the cursor will
          be moved to the top row in the same column.
          
          The home key will position the cursor on the upper left
          file name. (i.e. column one, row one)
          
          The <RETURN> key will move the cursor down one row in
          the same column.  When on the bottom row, the cursor will
          be moved to the top row in the next column to the right. 
          When on the last row of the rightmost column, the cursor
          will be moved to the first row of the leftmost column.
          
2  Remove

          Entering the R key marks the file name at the cursor
          position for removal from the directory.  The file will not
          be removed until the user exits using the <ENTER>,
          <ESC> or Quit commands.  Directory statistics for the
          number of files and blocks available are updated as if the
          file had been removed.  This allows the user to perform
          trial removes without disturbing the volume directory until
          satisfied with the results of the removal.
          
3  Change

          Entering a C key initiates a file name change.  Change
          allows the user to modify the file name at the cursor
          position.  Left and right arrow keys move the cursor across
          the file name field without disturbing the file name,
          character keys will replace the character at the cursor
          position, <ENTER> or <RETURN> accepts the modified
          name, and the <ESC> key aborts the change and restores
          the original file name.  Spaces internal to the file name
          are ignored and may be used to remove unwanted characters.
          
4  Undo

          Entering a U key restores the file name at the cursor
          position to the original name from the volume directory if
          changed, removed, or moved.  If the file has been moved,
          then only the displayed name is changed and the file on the
          destination volume is not disturbed.
          
5  Move

          Entering the M key moves the file at the cursor
          position to the destination volume.  If the destination
          volume has not been specified, then a request for the
          destination volume identification will be made.  The
          destination volume directory is searched for the file name
          and the user notified if the file name exists on the
          directory.
          
    THE.FILE is on destination volume, remove the old version?(Y/N)


          If the user enters a <Y>, the existing file on the
          destination will be removed and the file from the source
          will be copied to the destination.  If the entry is an
          <N>, the destination volume directory is not disturbed
          and no move takes place.  Unlike other functions, the move
          command is an immediate operation and the file will be
          moved before continuing.
          
6  Get

          Entering the G key initiates the entry of a new
          destination volume identification.  On entry of the volume
          identification, the new name becomes the destination
          volume.
          
7  Edit

          Entering the E key will call the system editor with
          the file name pointed to by the cursor.  
          
          If any file is marked for removal or a file name has
          been changed, then the utility will request verification of
          the changes with the prompt:
          
               Update the directory? (Yes/No/Return)
          
          The response to this prompt must be a <Y>, <N> or <R>
          - all other keys are ignored.  A <Y> response will cause
          the updated directory to be written to the blocked volume
          replacing the original directory.  An <N> response
          prevents the replacement of the orginal directory, and all
          modifications are ineffective.  An <R> response will
          return to the present directory display. After <Y> or
          <N> is entered, DF will call for the system editor with
          the file name at the cursor.
          
8  eXecute

          Entering the X key will execute a code file or
          redirect input from a script file.  When the cursor points
          to a file of type code and the X key is entered, the
          program in the code file will be executed.  When the cursor
          points to a file which is not of type code and the X key
          is entered, the file will be considered to be a script file
          and input will be redirected from the file.
          
          If any file is marked for removal or a file name has
          been changed, then the utility will request verification of
          the changes with the prompt:
          
               Update the directory? (Yes/No/Return)
               
          The response to this prompt must be a <Y>, <N> or <R>
          - all other keys are ignored.  A <Y> response will cause
          the updated directory to be written to the blocked volume
          replacing the original directory.  An <N> response
          prevents the replacement of the orginal directory, and all
          modifications are ineffective.  An <R> response will
          return to the present directory display. After <Y> or
          <N> is entered, DF will continue with the execute
          option.
          
 9  <ENTER>
10  <ESC>

          The <ENTER> and <ESC> keys exit the directory display,
          prompt for update of the disk directory, and prompt for a
          new volume identification.
          
          If any file is marked for removal or a file name has
          been changed, then the utility will request verification of
          the changes with the prompt:
          
               Update the directory? (Yes/No/Return)
               
          The response to this prompt must be a <Y>, <N> or <R>
          - all other keys are ignored.  A <Y> response will cause
          the updated directory to be written to the blocked volume
          replacing the original directory.  An <N> response
          prevents the replacement of the orginal directory, and all
          modifications are ineffective.  An <R> response will
          return to the present directory display. After <Y> or
          <N> is entered, the prompt for a volume identification
          will be presented.
          
          
11  Quit

          Entering the Q key will prompt for update of the
          directory and return to the PASCAL system.
          
          If any file is marked for removal or a file name has
          been changed, then the utility will request verification of
          the changes with the prompt:
          
               Update the directory? (Yes/No/Return)
          
          The response to this prompt must be a <Y>, <N> or <R>
          - all other keys are ignored.  A <Y> response will cause
          the updated directory to be written to the blocked volume
          replacing the original directory.  An <N> response
          prevents the replacement of the orginal directory, and all
          modifications are ineffective.  An <R> response returns
          to the present directory display. After <Y> or <N> is
          entered, DF will exit to the PASCAL system.
          
12  Help

          Entering the H key initiates a sequence of single line
          descriptions for the options available to the user.  The
          user is prompted to press the <RETURN> key to continue for
          each line displayed.
          
13  Output

          Entering the O key moves the volume directory display
          to a file or device specified by the user in response to
          the prompt:
          
               Enter the output file name :
               
14  Natural order

          Entering the N key for natural order will cause the
          directory file display to be presented in the order of
          occurrence on the disk.
          
15  Sorted order

          Entering the S key for sorted order will cause the
          directory file display to be presented in alphanumeric
          order by file name.
          
16  Logical order

          Entering the L key for logical order will cause the
          directory file display to be presented in alphanumeric
          order by the four character file suffix first and then by
          the file name.
          
17  Verify

          Entering the V key for verify will cause the directory
          file display to be rewritten.
          
18  Advance

          The A key invokes a directory display function which,
          if the cursor is pointing to a subsidirary volume, will
          advance to the subsidirary whether the volume is mounted or
          not.  This allows an unmounted subsidirary volume to be
          displayed and files to be extracted or deleted without
          requiring the user to mount the volume.
          
19  Formfeed

          Entering an F, when the destination is the printer,
