This Zip contains the USUS Software Library, volumes 1 through 29
plus USUS UK volumes UK3 and UK4.  

This archive was derived from .SVOL disk images that are available
on my web site.  All files were translated from UCSD P-System text
file format to DOS format, which means the .CODE files are present
but not intact.  Using the utilities on my web site, you can burst
the disk images in a different fashion if you like.
