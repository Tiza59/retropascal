{
 This unit was written to put in one place the screen handling conventions
 employed in the Grundler submissions.  This unit will have to be edited to
 fit your terminal or (in the case of the Terak) your terminal emulator.
 The parameters given here are for the Terak in the Terak terminal emulator
 mode (which was used by the reviewers).  Except for RLF, these will work also
 for the H19. The RLF given here for the H19 could work for the Terak (as 
 apparently there are some undocumented alternatives), but this was not tested.
 The original parameters from the Grundler submission are also given; presumably
 these are for a different terminal emulator. In the original submission,
 CLEARSCREEN appeared as PAGE(OUTPUT), and was intended to clear the screen
 of TEXT.  This will not work on our Teraks with UCSD version 2.0---and is
 considered by us to be obsolete. You will have to enter the proper code for
 the clearing of your TEXT screen without clearing the graphics screen.---
