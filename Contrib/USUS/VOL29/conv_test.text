*               SCRIPT CONV_TEST
*
*  This script provides a primitive test that CONVERS is installed
*  and executing properly.  Execute the script by starting CONVERS,
*  and entering:
*
*       CONV_TEST, DISPLAY_COMMANDS=YES, DISPLAY_LINK=YES
*
*  to the prompt.
*
*  The comments below tell what to expect as CONVERS executes.
*
*  The following Pause commands should each execute in approximately
*  one second.
pause
*
Pause
*
PAUSE
*
*  The following statements define some variables, and then execute
*  a WHILE loop three times.  Among other things, this tests that the
*  seek_line function of TEXTIO is working.
*
define, switch1=true, switch2=true
while, $VALUE ( switch1 )
  define, switch1 = $VALUE ( switch2 )
  define, switch2 = false
whilend
*
*  The following command should wait for a carrier to be detected.  If
*  no carrier is provided in approximately 30 seconds, it should abort.
*
wait
*
*  The following commands send some junk over the link, and then wait
*  for a (highly improbable) reply.  This may catch some drastic errors
*  in the installation.  For a more effective test, write your own scripts
*  based on the system with which you are communicating.
