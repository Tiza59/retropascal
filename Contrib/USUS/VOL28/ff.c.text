*** Do you want automatic month descriptions? (Y/N)  N 
 
allows the program to assign the standard month abbreviations either for rows
or columns in the Form.  If this option is selected, additional prompts will
ask if the headings are for rows or for columns and for the starting month
number. 
 
*** How many Calculation constants? __  (max. 200) 
 
allows the user to preset the constants which will be required in the
calculations.  Input the number of constants required; the program then asks
for the values to be assigned. 
 
*** CHECKPOINT ***  
 
     At this point, the user may elect to make corrections or change any or all
of the previous control data, terminate definition of this Form, or continue. 
First the user is prompted 
 
*** Anything to change? (Y/N)  N 
 
     If the response is <Y> the program returns to the number of pages prompt. 
If the response is <N>, the program continues gathering form parameters.  It
then asks  
 
*** How many columns might ever be in the FORM ? __  (max. 101) 
*** How many rows might ever be in the FORM ? __  (max. XXXX) 
 
The response to these prompts are critical to the definition of the FORM.  
These responses set limits to the size that the FORM will ever be able to
obtain.  The FORM may be altered later to contain fewer columns or rows but no
more. It is suggested to select maximums that are equal to the final number
desired currently plus enough for any additions to the FORM.  There is one way
to expand a FORM beyond these maximums and that is by using the Copy command
(see 1.6.3) 
 
*<Note> A FORM may contain no more than 32,704 numbers per page, therefore the 
maximum number of rows allowed will be a function of the maximum number of 
columns. 
 
     After the maximums have been set, the number of rows and columns that are 
actually going to be in the FORM at the present time are gathered.  The
maximum responses allowed here are determined by the answers just gathered. 
 
*** How many rows? __  (max. XXXX) 
*** How many columns? __  (max. XXX) 
 
These prompts accept only numeric values >=1  and <=max. specified. 
 
*** Are the dimensions ok as specified? (Y/N)  Y 
 
If the response is N, the maximum number of rows and columns and the actual
number of rows and columns prompts are repeated. 
 
The program will then update the FREEFORM directory file on the user diskette
and create the necessary control files. 
 
*** Enter Title for Page (60 char. max.)_______________ 
 
Each page of the Form may have its own unique title which will be displayed
when viewing and printed when listing.  This title may be up to 60 characters
max. and consist of most alphanumeric characters.  Invalid characters will not
be accepted from the keyboard. 
 
*** CHECKPOINT *** 
***Is Title Correct? (Y/N)  Y 
 
allows repeat of title entry until correct. 
 
 
1.2.2 Row and Column Parameter Definition 
 
     There are three parameters which must be defined for both rows and columns
of a Form:  description, type and cross calculation. 
 
     The description is a user-defined label which will be displayed and 
printed when using FREEFORM. 
 
     Type refers to one of the following valid types:  D-data, I-initial
calculations, F-final calculations, and H-heading.  Data type indicates the
values assigned to a row or column will be input by the user and are variable.
Calculated types indicate the values will be computed based on instructions
input by the user.  The precedence of calculations will vary according to one
of several cases which is determined by the mix of operations to be performed.
Initial calculations will be done before Final calculations.  For example, in a
Form formatted by rows, calculations will proceed as follows:  Initial
calculated rows, Initial calculated columns, Final calculated rows, and Final
calculated columns.  In a Form formatted by columns calculations will be
performed in the following order:  Initial calculated columns, Initial
calculated rows, Final calculated columns and Final calculated rows.  Heading
type is only a valid option for a row.  A row that is of Heading type will
not contain any data. 
 
     The third parameter refers to whether or not a cross-calculation can be 
done.  When defining a row, the question "O.K. to set values from Column
Calculations?" will be asked.  Type <N> if none of the data items in the row
being defined are allowed to be the direct result of a column calculation,
otherwise press <return>.  When defining a column, the question "O.K. to set
values from Row calculations?" will be asked.  Type <N> if none of the data
items in the column being defined are allowed to be the direct result of a row
calculation, otherwise press <return>. 
 
     A fourth parameter, Calculate string, will be prompted if the type of a 
row, or column, is specified as I or F.  Simple arithmetic relationships may
be expressed using the algebraic operators, + - / * ^  (^ is exponentiation),
row or column numbers, parenthesis to force the precedence of operators and any
constants if needed as explained earlier.  The exponentiation operator has the 
highest precedence, then multiplication and division and then addition and 
subtraction.  Sequences of operators of the same precedence are executed from 
left to right. 
 
Calculate examples: 
 
1.  Row 3 is to be the sum of rows 1 and 2.  Row 3 is declared to be type I and
the calculate string is entered as simply 1 + 2. 
 
2.  Column 1 is to be divided by column 8 and added to column 5 giving column 
12.  Column 12 must be declared as type I (or type F) and the calculate string 
is 1 / 8 + 5.  Other possibilities that will give the same results are 
( 1 / 8 ) + 5 and 5 + 1 / 8. 
 
3. Row 4 is the product of row 1 and row 2 divided by 1000 and minus row 3. A 
constant must have been pre-defined as 1000.  Assume it is the only constant 
for this Form, therefore it is constant (1).  Row 4 is declared type I and the 
calculate string ((1 * 2) / C1) - 3. 
 
*<Note> If automatic month headings for either rows or columns are specified, 
the parameters are preset, and all prompts are skipped. 
 
*<Note> If checkpoint prompts are suppressed, the user is not given the
opportunity to change any of the row or column parameters during Form 
definition. 
 
     Upon completion of the row and column parameter definition sequences,
the program will update the Form control file and create a data file 
initialized with no values. 
 
     A fifth parameter, Editing Format, must be specified for either rows or 
columns in accordance with the formatting option chosen earlier in the Form
definition process.  One may specify the print format to be used to display or
print Form data.  Each numeric field will hold thirteen characters and no more
than eleven may be to the right of the decimal point. 
 
Example: 1234.567        Editing Format      Result 
                                 
                                 ###            ***
                                ####           1235 
                              ####.#         1234.6 
                            ####.###       1234.567 
 
*<Note> If a number will not fit in its specified field, asterisks will be
displayed. 
*<Note> Rounding is done only on the display of the number and not on the
number's internal representation. 
 
If formatting is specified by rows, no prompts for editing columns will appear,
and the reverse is true if formatting is specified by columns. 
 
The Form is now stored and ready for use, and the user is returned to the main
menu.
