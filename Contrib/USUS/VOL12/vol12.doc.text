AUGMENT.TEXT      42  A program which adds timing info to a Pascal source 
                         file so that timing data can be obtained.  
ANALYZE.TEXT      24  Analyzes the results of AUGMENT.  Needs timer support.
R.ANALYZE.TEXT    24  Ditto except uses reals.

Some notes from the editor:

                                The WINDOW unit

     Austin Tate of USUS(UK) sent us this window manager unit.  It is well 
documented and it works pretty well if not a little slowly.  The demo program 
which (sort of) acts like the F(iler has a few problems, but it gets the point 
across.  You MUST have version IV.0 for this stuff to work.

                                    OFFLOAD

     Many business systems don't need the UCSD command prompt (after all, how 
much A(ssembling does a retailer do anyway?).  OFFLOAD shows how the standard 
prompt can be supressed and replaced by custom command prompts which do more 
closely what is necessary in a given application.  I found the documentation
on how to set up some of the cryptic data files somewhat lacking, but I got 
most of it to work.

                                   BENCHMARKS

     There are copies of some benchmark programs on this disk.  It would be 
nice if we could collect data taken from many systems to see how well each 
works, but alas, even the benchmarks are not standardized.  The infamous Byte 
benchmark is so prone to "tuning" that its data is almost meaningless.  This 
version has range checking disabled.  Some of the other benchmarks require 
IV.0 or timer support so that many systems cannot run them.  The "USUS" 
benchmark (by Jon Bondy) has been augmented with several new tests and 
requires only a stopwatch.

                              AUGMENT and ANALYZE
 
     These programs allow you to which part of your program is taking so much 
time, as if you didn't know already.  AUGMENT processes your source and 
inserts instructions at the beginning and end of each procedure to cause your 
program to time itself.  ANALYZE then processes the timing information and 
displays a report of how many times each procedure was accessed and how long 
it took.  You need timer support.  The program has been extensively hacked
by myself and Jim Gagne and still doesn't support units but at least now it 
handles (ugh) GOTO's and EXIT's and include files.  To get valid timing data 
you may find it necessary to separate user interface and data crunching into
separate routines, which you really should do anyway.

                                   DISK_COPY

     I copy USUS disks with this program and it hasn't failed me yet.  It 
reads a buffer full and then writes the buffer to disk.  It then re-reads the 
destination disk to see if the data is correct.  It won't correct for a bad 
master disk unless there is a CRC error nor will it discover some occurances 
of bad memory but it catches almost all of the typical problems (new disks are 
getting worse and worse, even "good" brands will have bad blocks right out of 
the box).

                                     CPROC

     I couldn't get this to work, it immediatly crashes my system (trap to 
location 4 on an LSI-11/23) when it is executed, but I suspect my IV.0 system 
as it has a tendency to crash.

                                    STARTUP

     This is a startup program which allows the prefix and date to be set.  It 
is IV.0 specific.  There is a II.0 version on volume 13.

                                    LMFORMAT

     This program processes a Pascal source file and translates everything to 
lower case EXCEPT reserved words.  It makes things look a little nicer.
