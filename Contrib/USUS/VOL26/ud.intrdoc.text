7.1 |INTRODUCTION|

7.1.1 |Overview|

	Universal Data Entry (|UDE|) enables users with little training to enter
data into computer files which can later be sorted, printed, or accessed by
other programs for data processing.  It provides prompts at fields in which
data is to be entered, and, if an error is detected, it advises the user.  The
screen prompts are created by the user with the help of the UDE Define
function.

	The UDE system is comprised of five programs: Define, Maintain, Sort, List
and Copy.  Define allows the user to set up the screen and record layout of a
data file.  Maintain collects data and enters it into a file which may be
scanned to change or delete a record.  Sort is used to sort the records by
field.  Up to ten fields may be used as keys, and each field may be sorted in
ascending or descending order.  The user may put the sorted results into a new
file if the data needs to be saved in its original form.  The keys used for
sorting may also be stored for subsequent use.

	List allows the user to list the records in the data file on a line or
letter-quality printer.  The list format is user-defined and allows choosing
the headings and footings which are to appear at the tops and bottoms of pages,
which fields and records are to be printed, and which headings are to appear
above each field.  Format information may be saved for use in printing other
data.  List also allows a user to "export" data file records into a text file
to do custom letter writing or address lists.

	Copy allows the user to copy data from selected fields and records of
either a UDE or GENLIST data file to a UDE data file.

	UDE may also be used in conjunction with other programs which read data
and process it by means of specially-prepared software.  Finally, UDE can
collect data for transmission to other computers for storage or processing.

	UDE can be used for name and address lists, inventory records, appointment
calendars, purchase order records, payroll records, and many other business
problems.

	To use UDE for a particular application, start the program by entering
/UDE from the main system menu or execute UD/UDE.CODE.  Define a data file
using the UDE Define function and specify the information (numbers, dates,
names, addresses, amounts, descriptions, etc.) needed in the data file.  This
process is very similar to designing a manual filing system and takes only a
few minutes to accomplish.

	Having defined a data file format, create the data file and enter
information using the Maintain function.  Once entered, any record can be
examined, changed or deleted.

	Information in the data file can be sorted, printed or copied as
required with the Sort, List and Copy functions.

[cp=18]	UDE for the PCIF system is made up of the following programs:
[in=5]
|UD/UDE.CODE| - Allows the user to choose the UDE function that is to be
performed.

|SD/DEFINE.CODE| - Defines the screen and record layout of a data file.

|UD/MAINT.CODE| - Creates a data file if necessary and maintains records in the
data file with add, examine, delete and modify commands.

|UD/SORT.CODE| - Sorts data file records.  This program requires the
file UD/SORT.SCRN be available on the prefixed disk.

|UD/LIST.CODE| - Lists the active records in the data file.  This program
requires the file UD/LIST.SCRN to be on the prefixed disk.

|UD/COPY.CODE| - Copies all or part of either a UDE or GENLIST data file to a
UDE data file.
[in]
[cp=4]7.1.2 |Screen Data Input|

	A defined UDE data file will appear on the screen as an number of prompts
followed by values.

[cp=10]***********************************************************************

[ce]|UDE Data File
[ce]Example 1

	1st prompt:_value1_          2nd prompt:_value2_
	3rd prompt:_value3_
	4th prompt:_value4_|

***********************************************************************

[cp=4]The underlined information is what the user enters into the data file.
The rest of the information is prompts that the user does not change.  For
instance, a UDE data file could be set up to store customer names, addresses
and telephone numbers.  The prompts on the screen might look like:

[cp=9]************************************************************************

[ce]|Customer Data File

	Name:_                    _   Telephone number:_            _
	Street:_                                  _
	City:_                _  State:_  _  Zip:_       _|

***********************************************************************

[cp=4]	Each piece of information the user enters on the screen is known as a
_field_.  So there is a name field, a telephone number field, and so on.  All
the fields on the screen, when taken together, are known as a _record_.  All
the records are called the _data file_.

[cp=4]	UDE collects all its records by presenting the screen to the user to
be filled in.  There is more information on entering records into UDE in the
Maintain section.  There are also some special keys that are used when entering
data.  These special keys are explained in Appendix D.

[cp=12]7.1.3 |Screen Messages|

	During the operation of UDE the following types of messages may be
displayed in the right half of the last line on the screen.
[in=5]
|STATUS:| Indicates the status of an operation.

|ERROR:| Indicates an error has occurred.

|WARNING:| Indicates the operator is about to perform a dangerous
operation.

|ACTION:| Indicates some action is required by the operator to
continue.
[in]
[cp=5]7.1.4 |Standard Screen Commands|

	Some of the screens displayed by UDE programs have the following standard
commands at the bottom of the screen.  All other commands, unique to a certain
UDE function, will be explained later in the manual.

[cp=4]7.1.4.1 |Execute Screen Functions|

	When the e|X|ecute command is in the lower left of the UDE
screen, press |<X>| to execute the function indicated by the screen display.
[cp=5]
7.1.4.2 |Changing Screen Data Fields|

	When the |C|hange command is in the lower left of the UDE screen, press
|<C>| to change the values in the data fields on the screen.  The cursor will be
put at the beginning of the first field.

[cp=4]7.1.4.3 |Quitting the Current Screen|

	When the |Q|uit command is in the lower left of the UDE screen, press
|<Q>| to exit the current operation.
