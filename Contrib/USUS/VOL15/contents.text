  This file describes the files contained on this diskette.
The files contain sources for two different separate
compilation units, each of which was written to conform to
the USUS Standard Remote Separate Compilation Unit of August
1981.  One of the units makes no assumptions about the modem
in use.  The other requires the Hayes Microcomputer Products
Smartmodem.
  The description of each group of files follows the
directory listing of the files.


HSM.TROOT.TEXT    16  5-Dec-81    6 Text

HSM.TINC2.TEXT    14  5-Dec-81   38 Text
  These files contain TERMINAL, a terminal emulation
program.  This version of TERMINAL will emulate a dumb
terminal as well as use the capabilities of auto-dial if the
Remote Unit claims auto-dial support is available.  The
program is also able to:
--Log received characters into a memory buffer and move the
  buffer to a user-named disk file.
--Send a text file to the remote system.
--Send logon text to the remote system.
--Change log files during a session.
--Purge the log file upon user request.
--Optionally respond to Compuserve's VideoTex CRT control
  codes.
See the source code for additional comments.
  To use the program, first compile a USUS Remote Unit.
Edit HSM.TROOT.TEXT's unit reference to point to the Unit's
code file.  Compile using HSM.TROOT.TEXT as the compiler
input file.  Using LIBRARY, create a code file containing
both the output of the HSM.TROOT.TEXT compile and the Remote
Unit object code.


HSM.UROOT.TEXT    22  5-Dec-81   52 Text
HSM.UINC1.TEXT    16  5-Dec-81   74 Text
HSM.UINC2.TEXT    14 22-Dec-81  158 Text
  These files contain an implemetation of the USUS Remote
Separate Compilation Unit of August 1981 which expects to
use a Hayes Smartmodem.  To use the unit, compile
HSM.UROOT.TEXT after editing in any changes required in the
CR_SETCOMMUNICATIONS routine.  See the comments in
HSM.UROOT.TEXT for additional guidance.

STD.UNIT.TEXT     24 16-Nov-81   90 Text
STD.UNIT.CODE     11 22-May-82  114 Code
  This implementation of the USUS Remote Unit assumes the 
minimum about the communications connection.  It is useful
when using an acoustic coupler environment or direct connect
modem which does not have auto-dial capabilities, as well as
in hardwire situations.  It does assume a synchronous BIOS
and a standard implementation of UnitStatus, UnitRead, and
UnitWrite.  It has been compiled under IV.0 and used
extensively.

USERLIB.TEXT       4 22-May-82  139 Text
  This is a user library file that points to the standard
unit's code file.  By entering "x" followed by 
"TERM.MAIN L=USERLIB" one executes the most recent version 
of TERMINAL.

TERM.EMUL.TEXT    10 29-May-82  172 Text
TERM.MAIN.TEXT    20 29-May-82  182 Text
TERM.INIT.TEXT    22 29-May-82  202 Text
TERM.LOG.TEXT     14 29-May-82  125 Text
TERM.UTIL.TEXT    22  3-Jun-82  232 Text
TERM.MAIN.CODE    32  3-Jun-82  254 Code
  These files also contain the source and object of
TERMINAL.  However, this version is much improved over the
other.  The code file is for version IV.0 and has been used
extensively.
  New and improved features of this version include:
  1) The memory buffer is moved to disk using
BLOCKWRITE, instead of the much slower WRITE/WRITELN. 
In addition, the file created is a legal text file. 
That is, each block pair ends with <return> followed by
nulls.
  2) TERMINAL tells you how large the log file is in
blocks.  This allows you to monitor the file size in
case your available space is limited.
  3) The Menu has more information in it.  The options 
selected, the name of the log file, and the logon text
selected are all displayed in the menu.
  4) When returning to terminal emulation from the
menu, the last 10 lines of the log file are
redisplayed.
  5) The program has been reorganized and segmented 
to fit smaller machines (like my 56K 8080).
  6) Logon text, previously compiled into the program,
is now stored in a file, along with default option
settings.  The file can reside on any blocked volume in
the set [4,5,9..17].  The program will search first the
prefix volume, then the system volume, then #4, #5, #9,
and up to #17:.
  The segmentation uses more segments than are available
in some versions of the p-System.  This may result in
compile errors under I.4, I.5, and II.x if some routines are
not removed from the list of segment procedures.  See the
documentation in TERM.MAIN.TEXT for additional information.
  To use the program, first compile a USUS Remote Unit. Edit
TERM.MAIN.TEXT's unit reference to point to the Unit's code
file.  Compile using TERM.MAIN.TEXT as the compiler input
file.  Using LIBRARY, create a code file containing both the
output of the HSM.TROOT.TEXT compile and the Remote Unit
object code or use a user library.
