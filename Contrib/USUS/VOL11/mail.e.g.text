This is a file of examples for the L)etter command of the program        
mail. The fields available for insertion anywhere in the letter are:

~ prefix to the name   :  (*PR*)
~ first name           :  (*FN*)
~ middle initial       :  (*MN*)
~ last name            :  (*LN*)
~ suffix to the name   :  (*SU*)
~ title                :  (*TI*)
~ company name         :  (*CN*)
~ phone number         :  (*PN*)
~ street address       :  (*AD*)
~ city                 :  (*CI*)
~ state                :  (*ST*)
~ country              :  (*CO*)
~ zip                  :  (*ZI*)
~ whole misc field     :  (*MI*)
~ misc sub-fields      :  (*M0*), (*M1*), (*M2*), (*M3*), (*M4*),
~                         (*M5*), (*M6*), (*M7*), (*M8*), (*M9*)

In addition to these other fixed fields there is one variable 
field called the 'Greeting' (in this case : (*GR*)).    
This field can be set up to a predetermined subset of the whole name
by using the 5 STANDARD FLAGS (44-48), or will default to an     
appropriate greeting (ie Mr. Smith  if possible or Bob or etc...)

~These fields may be left justified:  
~(*GR*)
~(* right justified::60*)  
~(* GR:60*)
~(* or centered::60 *) 
~(* GR:60 *)
~in any number of spaces.

The fields may be combined with or without regular text 
into larger tokens and these tokens may  
be left, right, or center justified just as individual tokens:
~(* (*PR*) (*FN*) (*MN*) (*LN*) (*SU*):60 *)

The right justification is automatic and
text
is 
taken
from
succsesive 
lines 
as
necessary
to 
make
up 
paragraphs.
In
fact,
the 
text
for
this
paragraph
is 
stored
as
consecutive
lines
of
single
words.
This is important when introducing tokens can upset the length of the line.
Lines can be input upto 255 characters in length with complete integrity
upon output. 

{%30/Flagged paragraphs are structures which allow individual records     
or groups of record to include specifed words, sentences, or paragraphs        
in text. 
Flags may be nested any number deep but tokens may only be nested one
level deep.
{%31/This sentence has the flag 31 tied to it. %}{%32/33/   
This sentence has the flags 32 and 33 tied to it. %}{%-32/You can 
specify sentences or paragraphs to be added if certain flags are NOT
set. %} In fact you can specify any number of flags to be set or
NOT set, and you can also determine if ALL specified flags (or NOT flags)
are necessary to include the
 paragraph or only ONE of the specified flags is needed.

%} 

[:l20:][:r20:]Spacing and Margin commands may be included in the text which will  
[:s3:]affect the output at the first opportunity and will last until a  
[:s2:][:r30:]new paragraph is started. At the beginning of each and every paragraph 
[:s1:][:l30:]the spacing and margins  are assigned to their default values.  
This is an example of these spacing and margin commands which
can be used for various purposes.

Within the program the records can be processed in a sequential manner.
Records can be selected for output to mailing labels or letters singly, or
by wildcard from any field, or to match a flag 
mask, or any combination therof.
The records may also be sorted by any field within the record.

The program has been made fail-safe by allowing one to Abort or
Update upon leaving or to individually Restore any record
changed. The program is self-initializing if the files are already
present. If not it allows one to specify the file upon which it
will act, and the disk upon which the output format data file 
will go. %}
