This volume holds a mailing address data base, mailing label and forms
letter production utility called MAIL along with associated text files
and utilities.

MAIL was initially written by Patrick Horton at Associated Computer
Industries.  It was subsequently updated and modified by Austin Tate
at the Edinburgh Regional Computing Centre.  The copyright was transfered
to Austin Tate in February 1982 by ACI.

The files available are:

MAIL.TEXT               The main program which has include files for the rest
MAIL1.TEXT              The include files follow.
MAIL2A.TEXT
MAIL2B.TEXT
MAIL3.TEXT
MAIL4.TEXT
MAIL5.TEXT
MAIL6.TEXT
MAIL7.TEXT
MAIL8.TEXT
MAIL9.TEXT

SCREENOPSX.TEXT        The MAIL program uses a UNIT SCREENOPS for screen
SCREENOPSA.TEXT        control.  In version IV and other systems which
                       provide a compatible SCREENOPS UNIT just use that.
                       If one is not available on your system, the two files
                       provided should provide enough of the SCREENOPS
                       functions to allow MAIL to work.  SCREENOPSX should
                       work with any VDU which uses FF (ASCII 12 decimal)
                       as the Clear Screen and Home control character.
                       SCREENOPSA is specifically for the Apple II and will
                       get the control characters from the *SYSTEM.MISCINFO
                       for UCSD II.1.
                       
MAIL.INIT.TEXT         A utility to initialise a MAIL data base from a
                       text file holding names and addresses. See the
                       documentation for more details.
                       
MAIL.DOC.TEXT          The documentation.  It was prepared with the UCSD
                       Advanced Systems Editor (ASE) from Volition Systems
                       and may be too large to edit with the standard
                       in-memory UCSD editor.  You should be able to list
                       it though.
                       
MAIL.READ.TEXT         This note.

MAIL.E.G.TEXT          A "form letter" which serves as an example of the
                       use of MAIL for building your own form letters.
MAIL.LETT.TEXT         A sample straightforward form letter, you could model
                       your own on this.
MAIL.FORM.TEXT         A "form" which can be used as a form letter to print
                       the information held i the data base about an
                       individual.  Usefule for reports, etc.
MAILINITEG.TEXT        An example file which can be used as input to the
                       MAIL.INIT utility to create a MAIL data base from
                       existing name and address lists.  Use this as a
                       sample to get the format correct.
                       
MAIL.CODE              On some disks, the code files for the MAIL and
MAIL.INIT.CODE         MAIL.INIT programs may be present.

MAIL.DATA              On some disks, the data files created (by default)
MAIL.INFO.DATA         by the MAIL program may be present.  If they are
                       present, the MAIL system will use these and not ask
                       you for your own mail files.  Rename or destroy
                       these two to start your own mailing lists.
                       
Preparation
-----------

The MAIL and MAIL.INIT programs have been made to be compatible with
a wide range of UCSD systems.  However, some changes are required to
the sources to allow compilation on pre-version IV UCSD systems.

1. Choose a suitable SCREENOPS UNIT if your system does not provide one
   and compile it to SCREENOPS.CODE on the prefix disk.  The MAIL sources
   assume that the inerface pert of SCREENOPS can be found in SCREENOPS.CODE.
   
2. For the Apple II, edit the compiler directive at the head of file
   MAIL.TEXT to include the V- option.  This is marked in the sources.
   
3. For UCSD versions which do not provide many segment slots (e.g., II.0
   Apple Pascal 1.0, etc) edit the SEGMENT PROCEDURE declarations in
   MAIL6.TEXT - for Add and Change procedures - to be normal PROCEDURES.
   The sources are marked appropriately.  This will have the effect of
   cutting down on heap space available for sorting, etc. so try to use
   the maximum number of segments that you can.
   
4. Now you should be able to compile MAIL.  Run the program and it will
   deal with all necessary file initialisation.  You can pre-initialise
   the mail data base from a text file holding names and addresses with
   the utility MAIL.INIT (prior to running MAIL)if you wish.
