The game is divided into camnpaigns which are further divided into rounds. 

A round is made up of one move for each person.

The person who starts the round is picked at random at the beginning
of the round.

The map legend is:

  *  -  sparsly populated rural region
  L  -  lake 
  F  -  forest (bad things can happen here)
  S  -  swamp  (ditto)
  T  -  Town (more populated than * )
  C  -  Castle 
  X  -  Capital
  
 
The object of the game is to wipe your opponent off the map.

This is done by entering into warfare. The victor will be the
one who is best prepared (ie. Most armies, In the capital, etc...)

The more people in your kingdom the more taxes you can collect.
The more taxes you collect the more armies you can buy at the
end of the campaign. Armies cost $2000.00 apiece.

The syntax of a square descriptor is:
 <square type><number of residents><Warlord (a or b)><number of armies>
 
Hence T12B4 is a town of 12 people held captive by warlord B with 4 armies.
 
You may enter moves thusly:
 <from square><blank or comma><to square><blank or comma><number of armies>
 
(the squares are designated row-column) so:

The move  12 34 5 means: move 5 armies from row 1 column 2 to row 3 column 4.

Good Luck, and may the best WARLORD win.
