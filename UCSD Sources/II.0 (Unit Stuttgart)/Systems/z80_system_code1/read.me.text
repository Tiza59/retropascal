The file Z80T.MICRO is the Z80 interpretter with transandental functions.
The interpretter, SYSTEM.MICRO, does not have these functions.  In order to
use the extra functions, save SYSTEM.MICRO by changing its name to something
else, then change the name of Z80T.MICRO to SYSTEM.MICRO.  Then reboot and
you are ready to go!.
