Downloaded on Feb 13 2013 from:

http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/bits/UCSD_Pascal/ucsd_II.0/

All dates I saw in the sources are before June 1 1979, thus they fall under the 2006 release,
although the release page itself only provides the 1.5 sources.
--TODO: check all sources one by one, look for any date > June 1 1979--

Note that binaries are not covered by this, i.e. I need to rebuild them all.
